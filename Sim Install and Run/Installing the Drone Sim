Drone sim using Python tutorial
Setup instructions from Tiziano


He uses VirtualBox, which works fine. I used VMWare Fusion because I already have it on my Mac, running an Ubuntu 18.04 installation.


1 - Install mavproxy:
apt install python-pip
pip install mavproxy


2 – Install dronekit toolbox:
pip install dronekit
pip install dronekit-sitl


3 – He doesn’t mention it, but you have to install Mission Planner:
Go to firmware.ardupilot.org/Tools/APMPlanner
Download and install the most recent version for your device.

4 - Write Python script
See my (extended) Python script file.

5 - The following steps are also in my how-to-run text file:
Start sim, giving starting location and a copter as a vehicle
Start mavproxy to connect to vehicle (port 5760) and share connection through UDP with localhost (port 14551) and external ground startion (port 14550).
Connect ground station to UDP port 14550.
Call the Python script, passing the UDP connection as argument.

6 - Watch it fly!
